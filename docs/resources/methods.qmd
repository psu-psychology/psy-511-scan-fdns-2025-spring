#### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

- Magnetic resonance a property of some isotopes and complex molecules
- Hydrogen ($H$), common in water & fat, is one
- In magnetic field, $H$ atoms absorb and release radio frequency (RF) energy
- $H$ atoms align with strong magnetic field
- Applying RF pulse perturbs alignment
- Rate/timing of realignment varies by tissue
- Realignment gives off radio frequency (RF) signals
- Strength of RF ~ density of $H$ (or other target)
- [$k$-space](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/k-space-1?lang=us) (frequency/phase) -> anatomical space
    - [Fourier analysis and synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) important for psychological/neural science, but possibly unfamiliar to many.
    - Frequency and phase $/rightarrow$ amplitude and location

- Radioactive tracers (glucose, oxygen)
- Positron decay activates paired detectors
- Tomographic techniques reconstruct 3D geometry
- Experimental condition - control
- Average across individuals
- Temporal (~ s) and spatial (mm-cm) resolution worse than fMRI
- Radioactive exposures + mildly invasive 
- Dose < airline crew exposure in 1 yr

##### Example: Neurotransmitter receptor binding and behavior

![[Figure 3 from @Kantonen2021-to]. The blue outline marks brain regions where lower [11C]carfentanil binding potential (BPND) associated with higher External eating score, age and PET scanner as nuisance covariates, cluster forming threshold p < 0.01, FWE corrected.

> Our main finding was that higher DEBQ scores were associated with lower central availability of MORs and CB1Rs in healthy, nonobese humans. MOR and CB1R systems however showed distinct patterns of associations with specific dimensions of self-reported eating: While CB1Rs were associated in general negatively with different DEBQ subscale scores (and most saliently with the Total DEBQ score), MORs were specifically and negatively associated with externally driven eating only. Our results support the view that variation in endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems explain interindividual variation in feeding, with distinct effects on eating behavior measured with DEBQ.

##### Comparing PET and fMRI

![[Figure 2 from @Rischka2018-pk]. Fig. 2. Task-specific changes during finger tapping and visual stimulation obtained with fPET and fMRI across all subjects. Good agreement between CMRGlu and BOLD was observed for primary motor and visual cortices. However, in secondary areas (e.g., supplementary motor area, cerebellum, secondary visual areas) significant changes were only detected with fMRI but not with fPET (Table 2). Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons at p<0.05 FWE corrected voxel-level.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S105381191830586X-gr2_lrg.jpg){.lightbox}

> The brain's energy budget can be non-invasively assessed with different imaging modalities such as functional MRI (fMRI) and PET (fPET), which are sensitive to oxygen and glucose demands, respectively. The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems further enables the simultaneous acquisition of these parameters...The absence of a correlation and the different activation pattern between fPET and fMRI suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen demand capture complementary aspects of energy demands.

#### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

- Neural activity -> local $O_2$ consumption increase
- *Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)* response
- Oxygenated vs. deoxygenated hemoglobin ≠ magnetic susceptibility
- How do regional blood $O_2$ levels (& flow & volume) vary with behavior X?
- MRI "signals" relate to the speed (1/T) of "relaxation" of the perturbed nuclei to their state of alignment with the main ($B_0$) magnetic field.
- Imaging protocols emphasize different time constants of this relaxation ($T1$, $T2$, $T2^*$); $T^{2^*}$ for BOLD imaging

##### Evaluating fMRI

- Non-invasive, but expensive
- Moderate but improving (mm) spatial, temporal (~sec) resolution
- Spatial limits due to 
    - field strength (@ 3T $~3mm^3$ voxel)
    - Physiology of hemodynamic response
- Temporal limits due to
    - Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF): ~ 1s delay plus 3-6 s ramp-up
    - Speed of image acquisition
- *Indirect* measure of neural activity

##### Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)

> [@Szucs2017-fc]

- Solutions
    - Make data, materials (analysis code) more widely and openly available
    - [OpenNeuro.org](https://openneuro.org), [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/), [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org), etc.
    - Reuse shared data (e.g., [Adolescent Brain & Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study](https://abcdstudy.org/))
    - Increase sample sizes, improve detection of small effects

#### Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)

- Near infrared light penetrates scalp and skull, refracted by brain tissue
- Returned signal altered by blood $O_2$ levels
- Time course (temporal resolution) ~ BOLD fMRI
- Spatial resolution low
- More suitable than fMRI for pediatric populations (less susceptible to movement artefact)

    + MIDDLE: Quiet, alert state (alpha $\alpha$ band)
    + HIGHER: Sensorimotor activity reflecting observed actions? (mu or $\mu$ band), [@Hobson2017-oj]
    + HIGHER STILL: “Binding” information across senses or plasticity? (gamma or $\gamma$ band), [@Amo2017-tz]

- Pharmacological
- Magnetic (**Transcranial magnetic stimulation - TMS**)
- Spatial/temporal resolution?
- Assume stimulation mimics natural activity?

### Or synthesizing one...

#### Human brain organoids

> Brain organoids represent a powerful tool for studying human neurological diseases, particularly those that affect brain growth and structure. However, many diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-α. Together, these findings provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility in therapeutic discovery.

![[Figure 2 from @Samarasinghe2021-dk]. a, Schematic illustrating the identification of active neurons by virtue of their Ca2+ transients (I), representation of their network organization (II) and methods used to collect extracellular recordings (III). b, Example of live two-photon microscopy imaging of an H9 hESC-derived fusion organoid demonstrating acquisition of regions of interest (red circles) and the resulting activity profile shown as normalized ΔF/F values, where each line is an individual neuron (middle) and representation of the same data as a colorized amplitude plot (right). c, Addition of 100 μM BMI had a minimal effect on Cx + Cx fusions (top) yet elicited spontaneous synchronization of neural activities in Cx + GE organoids (bottom). d, These synchronizations can be transformed into a normalized amplitude-versus-time plot for quantitative analyses (left) and further visualized as a clustergram following hierarchical clustering of calcium spiking data (right). e, Pooled data of the amplitude measurements. Plots display the full distribution of individual data points. Dashed and dotted lines indicate the median and quartile values, respectively. n = 3 independent experiments for Cx + Cx and Cx + GE. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) P = 0.0011, F = 8.301, d.f. (between columns) = 3 followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test; **P = 0.0028 for Cx + Cx versus Cx + GE BMI; **P = 0.0100 for Cx + Cx BMI versus Cx + GE BMI; **P = 0.0031 for Cx + GE versus Cx + GE BMI. f–h, LFPs measured from a representative Cx + GE fusion revealed robust oscillatory activities at multiple frequencies during a 5-min period, reflected in both raw traces (f) and the spectrogram (g). Spectral density analysis in h demonstrates the presence of multiple distinct oscillatory peaks ranging from ~1–100 Hz. i–k, Cx + Cx fusion organoids by contrast lack measurable oscillatory activities. Representative traces in f–h are taken from three independent experiments and in i–k from four independent experiments.
