Figure 1. Evidence of corticomotoneuronal connections in human subjects. Indirect, noninvasive evidence of the existence of monosynaptic connections between corticospinal neurons and spinal motoneurons may be obtained in awake human subjects by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (b,c) and coherence analysis of either cortical [electroencephalogram (EEG)] and muscular activity [electromyogram (EMG)] (d,e) or two separate recordings of muscular activity (f). (b,c) Corticospinal neurons can be excited by a brief magnetic pulse applied by a magnetic coil placed over the appropriate part of the motor cortex in awake human subjects. If the intensity of the magnetic pulse is adjusted appropriately, the evoked descending volley in the corticospinal tract may elicit a subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in the relevant spinal motoneurons. This EPSP may be demonstrated as a change in the discharge probability of a single motor unit recorded from the muscle (b). In the illustrated example, the subject was asked to voluntarily activate the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, and the discharges of a single motor unit were recorded by a needle electrode inserted into the muscle. TMS elicited a short-lasting (2-ms) increase of discharge probability at a latency of 45 ms (b). The short duration of this peak is consistent with the short rise time of a monosynaptic EPSP. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that stimulation of Ia afferents with known monosynaptic connections to the motoneurons elicits a peak with a similar short duration (c). Data in panels b and c modified with permission from Nielsen & Petersen (1994). (d,e) EEG recorded from the motor cortex and EMG recorded from a voluntarily activated muscle (TA in the illustrated example) show rhythmic modulation of the recorded activity at a frequency of 15–35 Hz. As shown from a coherence analysis of the two signals in panel d, some of this activity is common for the two sites, suggesting a close link between cortical and muscular activity. Panel e shows the EEG and EMG activities are not always synchronous but may show a time lag, which is in the range expected for a fast-conducting direct pathway to the motoneurons. Data in panels d and e modified with permission from Hansen et al. (2002). (f) A monosynaptic origin of corticomuscular coherence is further supported by the observation of short-term synchrony between the discharges of pairs of TA motor units, which may be related to the coherence in the 15–35-Hz frequency band. The subject was asked to voluntarily activate the TA muscle, and the discharges of two different TA motor units were recorded with needle electrodes. The short duration of the central peak of synchronization suggests that the motor unit activities are modulated by a common (monosynaptic) input from collaterals of last-order neurons, which are in all likelihood identical to corticomotoneuronal cells. The secondary peaks at lags of approximately 50–60 ms on either side of the central peak suggest that this last-order input modulates the discharge of the motor units at a frequency of about 20–30 Hz, i.e., corresponding to the coherence observed in the paired EEG-EMG recordings in panels b and c. Data in panel f modified with permission from Nielsen & Kagamihara (1994)."

Figure 1. Schematic illustrating the focus of the representational perspective and of the dynamical systems perspective. The traditional perspective has concentrated on the representation or code employed by the motor cortex. For example, does the motor cortex (upper left panel) code muscle activity (red trace) or reach velocity (black trace)? Thus, the traditional perspective attempts to determine the output or controlled parameters of the motor cortex. The dynamical systems perspective focuses less on the output itself and more on how that output is created (upper right panel). It attempts to isolate the basic patterns (blue) from which the final output might be built. It further attempts to understand the dynamics that produced that set of patterns and the role of preparatory activity in creating the right set of patterns for a particular movement. The red trace indicates the activity of the deltoid versus time during a rightward reach (e.g., Churchland et al. 2012). The black trace is the hand velocity for that same reach; the black trace between the beginning and ending reach targets is the hand path. The light and dark blue traces (upper right) illustrate a potential dynamical basis set from which the red trace might be built.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Shenoy et al., 2013). Figure 2. Overview of experimental paradigm, behavioral measurements, muscle measurements, and neural measurements. (a) Illustration of the instructed-delay task. Monkeys sit in a primate chair ∼25 cm from a fronto-parallel display. A trial begins by fixating (eye) and touching (hand) a central target (red filled square) and holding for a few hundred milliseconds. A peripheral target (red open square) then appears, cuing the animal about where a movement must ultimately be made. After a randomized delay period (e.g., 0–1 s) a go cue is given (e.g., extinction of central fixation and touch targets) signaling that an arm movement to the peripheral target may begin. (b) Sample hand measurements and electromyographic (EMG) recordings for the same trial as in panel a. Top: Horizontal hand (black) and target (red) positions are plotted. For this experiment, the target jittered on first appearing and stabilized at the go cue. Bottom: Hand velocity superimposed on the voltage recorded from the medial deltoid. (c) Sample reach trajectories and end points in a center-out two-instructed-speed version of the instructed-delay task. Red and green traces/symbols correspond to instructed-fast and instructed-slow conditions. (d) Mean reaction time (RT) plotted versus delay-period duration. The line shows an exponential fit.

Monoamine transporters are localized to perisynaptic sites, where they are crucial for the termination of monoamine transmission and the maintenance of presynaptic monoamine storage. Several selective pharmacological agents acting at each monoamine transporter are shown.

Neurons can be classified using morphological, physiological and molecular criteria. a | Representative examples of five subclasses of cortical neurons obtained from brain slices. The cells were filled with biocytin, stained and imaged following patch clamp recording (see part b). Each subclass has distinct morphological features. For the four interneurons on the left, the dendrites are shown in dark grey and the axons in light grey. The soma of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A-expressing (HTR3A+) sparse neuro- gliaform cell is located in layer 1, and its axons are also concentrated in this layer. The vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) bipolar cell has a characteristic bipolar dendritic extension. The soma of the somatostatin-expressing (SST+) deep Martinotti cell is located in layer 5/6, and its axons extend upward into layer 1. The parvalbumin-expressing (PVALB+) basket cell has basket-like axonal arborisation. For the excitatory neuron on the right, the apical dendrites are shown in dark grey and the basal dendrites in light grey. This is a layer 5, thick-tufted cell from a retinol-binding protein 4 (Rbp4) gene promoter-driven Cre-expressing mouse. The cell features thick apical dendritic tufts extending into layer 1. These morphological features are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. b | Differential electrophysiological responses of the five subclasses of neurons shown in part a to square pulses of current in patch clamp recordings. For example, the HTR3A+ cell is late spiking, whereas the PVALB+ cell is fast spiking. These responses are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. c | Differential molecular signatures of the five subclasses of cortical neurons illustrated in part a derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The violin plot shows the collective gene expression profile for each gene of all the cells in a type (cluster). We define the smallest discrete clusters of cells as types and the aggregates of types that share common features as classes or subclasses. Each transcriptomic cell type is shown as a column of data points with the same colour (the colour coding corresponds to that of the transcriptomic taxonomy shown in Fig. 5). Shown here are three interneuron cell types expressing Htr3a but notVip, six interneuron cell types expressing Vip, six interneuron cell types expressing Sst and seven interneuron cell types expressing Pvalb. All of the interneurons express glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1). Also shown are eight layer 5 excitatory neuron types, all of which express solute carrier family 17 member 7 (Slc17a7). All of the cells express synaptosome-associated protein 25 (Snap25). The height of each ‘violin’-shaped data point represents the range of expression levels of the gene, and the width represents the proportion of cells displaying a particular level of expression. Parts a and b are from the Allen Cell Types Database (see Further Information). Part c is adapted with permission from Ref. 136.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 6 from Zeng & Sanes, 2017). The figure shows a proposed hierarchical classification of cells in the retina (a) and cerebral cortex (b). In both areas, individual cell types can be grouped into classes, and intermediate levels of subclasses can be determined based on distinct morphological, physiological and molecular features. Higher-order groupings (such as those shown in part a, including sensory neurons, interneurons and projection neurons) may emerge once enough areas have been provided and compared. Types are the commonly recognized (‘validated’) terminal branches in the current hierarchical arrangement of cell types. Lower-order groupings into subtypes may largely be provisional until additional data are collected that could determine if they could form new types or should be merged into other types. Dashed lines indicate the presence of additional types that cannot be labelled due to lack of space. The question marks in part a indicate that the hierarchical relationship among the indicated cell types remains unclear. The question mark in part b indicates that the status of the cortical cell groups indicated may be either subclasses, types or subtypes. CT, cortico-thalamic neurons; DS, direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); F, forkhead box P2 (Foxp2)-expressing RGCs; HTR3A, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A; ipRGC, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs; IT, intratelencephalic neurons; L4, layer 4; L6b, layer 6b subplate neurons; nGnG, non-GABAergic-non-glycinergic amacrine cells; ooDSGC, ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs; PT, pyramidal tract neurons; PVALB, parvalbumin; SST, somatostatin; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 4 from Boldog et al., 2018). a, Examples of different firing patterns induced by current injections in layer 1 interneurons. Firing pattern of an RC (top), an NGFC (middle), and an unidentified layer 1 interneuron (bottom). b, SVM-based wrapper-feature selection of electrophysiological parameters for the identification of RCs. Anatomically identified RCs (red dots) and other types of interneurons with known morphology (black dots) are mapped to the distribution of electrophysiological features ranked as the two best delineators by SVM. Black lines show the best hyperplane separating RCs from other interneuron types. c,d, RCs exhibit a distinct impedance profile relative to neurogliaform and other human interneurons in layer 1. (c) Individual responses of anatomically identified rosehip (red), neurogliaform (blue), and other (black) interneurons to current injections with an exponential chirp (0.2–200 Hz; top). Traces were normalized to the amplitude of the rosehip response at 200 Hz. (d) Left: normalized impedance (Z) profiles of distinct groups of interneurons. RCs (n=5) had higher impedance in the range of 0.9–12.4 Hz compared to neurogliaform (n=5) and other (n=5) interneurons. Shaded regions represent s.d. Right: impedances were similar at the lowest frequency (Z0.2 Hz; left), but resonance magnitude (Q) calculated as maximal impedance value divided by the impedance at lowest frequency (middle) and frequencies of maximal impedance (fmax; right) showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc correction). e, Automatized selection of recording periods for assessing subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (boxed segments) and detection of bursts (bars) for measuring intraburst spiking frequency demonstrated on an RC response to near-rheobasic stimulation showing stuttering firing behavior. f, Averaged fast fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of membrane potential oscillations had higher power between 3.8 and 80 Hz in RCs compared to neurogliaform and other interneurons. g, Intraburst frequency of RCs peaked in the gamma range.

    "text": "This meta-analytic investigation demonstrates that there is no 1-to-1 mapping between an emotion category and a specific autonomic nervous system response pattern. In addition, we observed substantial variability in autonomic nervous system changes during instances of the same emotion category that was not accounted for by experimental moderators (such as the way the emotion was induced). These findings suggest that autonomic nervous system changes during emotion are less like a bodily fingerprint and more like a population of variable, context sensitive instances. (Siegel et al., 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa, Glerean, Hari, & Hietanen, 2014). The emBODY tool. Participants colored the initially blank body regions (A) whose activity they felt increasing (left body) and decreasing (right body) during emotions. Subjectwise activation–deactivation data (B) were stored as integers, with the whole body being represented by 50,364 data points. Activation and deactivation maps were subsequently combined (C) for statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa et al., 2014). Bodily topography of basic (Upper) and nonbasic (Lower) emotions associated with words. The body maps show regions whose activation increased (warm colors) or decreased (cool colors) when feeling each emotion. (P &lt; 0.05 FDR corrected; t &gt; 1.94). The colorbar indicates the t-statistic range.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa et al., 2014). Hierarchical structure of the similarity between bodily topographies associated with emotion words in experiment 1 (Upper) and basic emotions across experiments with word (W), story (S), movie (M), and Face (F) stimuli (Lower).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett (2012)\n\n\n\nWhere in the brain is emotion processed?\n\n\n\n\n(Lindquist et al., 2012). Figure 1. Locationist Hypotheses of Brain–Emotion Correspondence. A: Lateral view. B: Sagital view at the midline. C: Ventral view. D: Coronal view. Brain regions hypothesized to be associated with emotion categories are depicted. Here we depict the most popular locationist hypotheses, although other locationist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence exist (e.g., Panksepp, Reference Panksepp1998). Fear: amygdala (yellow); Disgust: insula (green); Anger: OFC (rust); Sadness: ACC (blue). A color version of this image can be viewed in the online version of this target article at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA psychological constructionist account of emotion assumes that emotions are psychological events that emerge out of more basic psychological operations that are not specific to emotion. In this view, mental categories such as anger, sadness, fear, et cetera, are not respected by the brain (nor are emotion, perception, or cognition, for that matter.\n\n\n…emotions emerge when people make meaning out of sensory input from the body and from the world using knowledge of prior experiences. Emotions are “situated conceptualizations” (cf. Barsalou 2003) because the emerging meaning is tailored to the immediate environment and prepares the person to respond to sensory input in a way that is tailored to the situation\n\n\n\n\n(Lindquist et al., 2012). Figure 4. The Neural Reference Space for Discrete Emotion. The neural reference space (phrase coined by Edelman [1989]) is the set of brain regions consistently activated across all studies assessing the experience or perception of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness (i.e. the superordinate category emotion). Brain regions in yellow exceeded the height threshold (\\(p&lt;.05\\)) and regions in orange exceeded the most stringent extent-based threshold (\\(p&lt;.001\\)). Regions in pink and magenta correspond to lesser extent-based thresholds and are not discussed in this article. Cortex is grey, the brainstem and nucleus accumbens are green, the amygdala is blue and the cerebellum is purple. A color version of this image can be viewed in the online version of this target article at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Lindquist et al., 2012). Figure 5. Logistic Regression Findings. Selected results from the logistic regressions are presented (for additional findings, see Table S6 in supplementary materials). Circles with positive values represent a 100% increase in the odds that a variable predicted an increase in activity in that brain area. Circles with negative values represent a 100% increase in the odds that a variable predicted there would not be an increase in activity in that brain area.

    "text": "This meta-analytic investigation demonstrates that there is no 1-to-1 mapping between an emotion category and a specific autonomic nervous system response pattern. In addition, we observed substantial variability in autonomic nervous system changes during instances of the same emotion category that was not accounted for by experimental moderators (such as the way the emotion was induced). These findings suggest that autonomic nervous system changes during emotion are less like a bodily fingerprint and more like a population of variable, context sensitive instances. (Siegel et al., 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa, Glerean, Hari, & Hietanen, 2014). The emBODY tool. Participants colored the initially blank body regions (A) whose activity they felt increasing (left body) and decreasing (right body) during emotions. Subjectwise activation–deactivation data (B) were stored as integers, with the whole body being represented by 50,364 data points. Activation and deactivation maps were subsequently combined (C) for statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa et al., 2014). Bodily topography of basic (Upper) and nonbasic (Lower) emotions associated with words. The body maps show regions whose activation increased (warm colors) or decreased (cool colors) when feeling each emotion. (P &lt; 0.05 FDR corrected; t &gt; 1.94). The colorbar indicates the t-statistic range.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nummenmaa et al., 2014). Hierarchical structure of the similarity between bodily topographies associated with emotion words in experiment 1 (Upper) and basic emotions across experiments with word (W), story (S), movie (M), and Face (F) stimuli (Lower).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett (2012)\n\n\n\nWhere in the brain is emotion processed?\n\n\n\n\n(Lindquist et al., 2012). Figure 1. Locationist Hypotheses of Brain–Emotion Correspondence. A: Lateral view. B: Sagital view at the midline. C: Ventral view. D: Coronal view. Brain regions hypothesized to be associated with emotion categories are depicted. Here we depict the most popular locationist hypotheses, although other locationist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence exist (e.g., Panksepp, Reference Panksepp1998). Fear: amygdala (yellow); Disgust: insula (green); Anger: OFC (rust); Sadness: ACC (blue). A color version of this image can be viewed in the online version of this target article at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA psychological constructionist account of emotion assumes that emotions are psychological events that emerge out of more basic psychological operations that are not specific to emotion. In this view, mental categories such as anger, sadness, fear, et cetera, are not respected by the brain (nor are emotion, perception, or cognition, for that matter.\n\n\n…emotions emerge when people make meaning out of sensory input from the body and from the world using knowledge of prior experiences. Emotions are “situated conceptualizations” (cf. Barsalou 2003) because the emerging meaning is tailored to the immediate environment and prepares the person to respond to sensory input in a way that is tailored to the situation\n\n\n\n\n(Lindquist et al., 2012). Figure 4. The Neural Reference Space for Discrete Emotion. The neural reference space (phrase coined by Edelman [1989]) is the set of brain regions consistently activated across all studies assessing the experience or perception of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness (i.e. the superordinate category emotion). Brain regions in yellow exceeded the height threshold (\\(p&lt;.05\\)) and regions in orange exceeded the most stringent extent-based threshold (\\(p&lt;.001\\)). Regions in pink and magenta correspond to lesser extent-based thresholds and are not discussed in this article. Cortex is grey, the brainstem and nucleus accumbens are green, the amygdala is blue and the cerebellum is purple.

Figure 1. Characteristic response to reward and punishment by different neurons. (a) Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons encode reward prediction error (RPE) signals, showing excitatory responses only when the reward is not fully predicted (Cohen et al. 2012, Schultz 1998). (b) VTA GABA neurons encode reward expectation, contributing to RPE calculation by serving as a source of subtraction (Eshel et al. 2015). (c) Lateral habenula (LHb) neurons show mirror-inverted phasic responses to DA neurons, potentially providing a source of negative RPE signals (Matsumoto & Hikosaka 2009a). (d,e) Recordings from dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonergic (5-HT) neurons reveal diverse responses to reward and punishment, with a substantial subset showing excitatory responses to reward even when reward is predicted (Cohen et al. 2015, Li et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2014). (f) DRN GABA neurons are inhibited by reward seeking and activated by aversive stimuli. Green, red, and blue dashed lines indicate the timing of reward cue, reward delivery, and punishment delivery, respectively. Purple dashed lines indicate entry into a reward zone in a sucrose-foraging task. The responses of DRN 5-HT and GABA neurons to unexpected reward and punishment are derived from calcium-imaging fiber photometry experiments. All others are from single-unit electrophysiological recordings.\n\n\nDA and GABA signaling\n\n\n\n(Watabe-Uchida, Eshel, & Uchida, 2017). Firing patterns of identified dopamine and GABA neurons in VTA. (a) VTA neurons were recorded while mice performed an odor-outcome association task in which different odors predicted different outcomes (see legend on right). Odors were presented for 1 s (gray shading), and outcomes were presented after a 1-s delay. Neuron types were identified based on their optogenetic responses. Dopamine neurons (left) showed phasic excitations to reward-predictive cues and reward. GABA neurons (right) showed sustained activation during the delay. Data from Cohen et al. (2012). (b) Reward expectation modulates dopamine neuron firing. The plot on the left shows when outcome was presented, and the right-hand plot shows when outcome was omitted. Different odors predicted reward with different probabilities. Higher reward probability increased cue responses but suppressed reward responses. Data from Tian & Uchida (2015). Also see Fiorillo et al. (2003) and Matsumoto & Hikosaka (2009a,b). (c) Reward context-dependent modulation of dopamine responses to air puff–predictive cues and air puff. The task conditions during recording differed only in the probability of reward. Dopamine neurons showed both excitation and inhibition in high-reward contexts (left) but only inhibition in low-reward contexts (right). The response in reward trials is not shown.

Subtractive computation in dopamine neurons. (a) In one task condition (no odor, black), different amounts of reward were presented without any predictive cue. In another condition (odor A, orange), the timing of reward was predicted by an odor. (b) Prediction. Division should change the slope of the curve, whereas subtraction should cause a downward shift. (c) Average response of 40 optogenetically identified dopamine neurons. Prediction caused a subtractive shift. Data from Eshel et al. (2015). (d) Three example neurons.

    "text": "From structural development to functional development\n\n\n\n(M. H. Johnson, 2001). Figure 3: Three accounts of the neural basis of an advance in behavioural abilities in infants. a | A maturational view in which the neuroanatomical maturation of one region, in this case the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), allows new behavioural abilities to emerge. Specifically, maturation of DLPC has been associated with successful performance in the object retrieval task (Fig. 1a)50. Note that although the task itself involves activity in several regions, it is thought to be maturation of only one of these, the DLPC, that results in changed behaviour. b | An interactive specialization view in which the onset of a new behavioural ability is due to changes in the interactions between several regions that were already partially active. In this hypothetical illustration, it is suggested that changes in the interactions between DLPC, parietal cortex and cerebellum might give rise to successful performance in the object retrieval paradigm. In contrast to the maturational view, it is refinement of the connectivity between regions, rather than within a single region, that is important. According to this view, regions adjust their functionality together to allow new computations. c | A skill-learning model, in which the pattern of activation of cortical regions changes during the acquisition of new skills throughout the lifespan. In the example illustrated there is decreasing activation of DLPC and medial frontal cortex (pre-supplementary motor area), accompanied by increasing activation of more posterior regions (such as intraparietal sulcus), as human adults perform a visuomotor sequence learning task77. It is suggested that similar changes might occur during the acquisition of new skills by infants. These three accounts are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\nDifferent hardware = different computations?\n\nResearchers routinely use motor behaviors (e.g., eye, face, and limb movements) to index cognition in the human neonate.\n\n\nWhen developmental researchers use infant movements to index cognition, they often assume that the cortex is involved in producing the behavior.\n\n\nHowever, cortical control of movement is absent at birth, emerging gradually over the first several postnatal months and beyond; before cortical outflow emerges, brainstem networks produce complex motor behavior.\n\n\nThus, cortical control of the motor behaviors used to infer cognition in neonates is not neurobiologically plausible.\n\n\nResearchers should be cautious when making claims about developmental continuity between newborn and adult cognition (i.e., ‘core knowledge’) and its supporting neural architecture.\n\n(Blumberg & Adolph, 2023)\n\n\n\n(Figure 1 from Blumberg & Adolph, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure I from Blumberg & Adolph, 2023). Sensory origins of primary motor cortex (M1). (A) Boundaries of primary cortical areas in rats: primary somatosensory cortex (S1, red) and M1 (blue), and primary auditory (A1) and visual (V1) cortex.

(C) Peri-event histogram showing sensory responsiveness of an individual neuron in the forelimb region of M1 at P20. The neuron’s firing rate is shown in relation to movement onset (vertical broken line) for twitches (red) and wake movements (black). This neuron is representative of all M1 neurons recorded at this age. Neurons fire above baseline (0 on the y-axis) after – not before – movement onset during both sleep and wake, indicative of sensory responding.

Each map was produced using intracortical microstimulation in the forelimb region of M1 in anesthetized animals.

Furthermore, 79% of patients showed infra-normal deviations for at least one locus (healthy individuals: 59 ± 2%, p &lt; 0.001).

Figure 1. De-coupling of network structure and function in schizophrenia. (a) Shows an example of a brain-wide map of structural connectivity deficits in patients with schizophrenia, highlighting a relatively diffuse impairment that particularly affects fronto-posterior anatomical connectivity. In this whole-brain analysis, no increases of structural connectivity were found. Letters denote different regions (see below for key). (b) Illustrates frontal regions showing decreased and increased functional connectivity with seed regions in the dorsal (top) and ventral (bottom) caudate nucleus, respectively, in patients with schizophrenia (yellow, blue) and their unaffected, first-degree relatives (magenta, green). Thus, despite a fairly global impairment of structural connectivity (depicted in (a)), systems-specific increases in functional connectivity can be observed (b). (c,d) Brain-wide alterations of structural (c) and functional (d) connectivity in the same sample of patients with schizophrenia. Blue and green depict links where anatomical and functional connectivity, respectively, were reduced in patients; red depicts links where functional connectivity was increased in the patient group.

(A) Power of CGm signal in 90 SCZ patients (red) relative to 90 HCS (black) (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for demographics). (B) Mean power across all frequencies before and after GSR indicating an increase in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 7.42, P &lt; 0.01], and attenuation by GSR [F(1, 178) = 5.37, P &lt; 0.025]. (C) CGm variance also showed increases in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 7.25, P &lt; 0.01] and GSR-induced reduction in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 5.25, P &lt; 0.025]. (D–F) Independent SCZ sample (see SI Appendix, Table S2 for demographics), confirming increased CGm power [F(1, 143) = 9.2, P &lt; 0.01] and variance [F(1, 143) = 9.25, P &lt; 0.01] effects, but also the attenuating impact of GSR on power [F(1, 143) = 7.75, P &lt; 0.01] and variance [F(1, 143) = 8.1, P &lt; 0.01]. (G–I) Results for BD patients (n = 73) relative to matched HCS (see SI Appendix, Table S3 for demographics) did not reveal GSR effects observed in SCZ samples [F(1, 127) = 2.89, P = 0.092, n.s.] and no evidence for increase in CGm power or variance. All effects remained when examining all gray matter voxels (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Error bars mark ± 1 SEM. ***P &lt; 0.001 level of significance. n.s., not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Yang et al., 2014). Fig 2. Relationship between SCZ symptoms and CGm BOLD signal power. We extracted average CGm power for each patient with available symptom ratings (n = 153). (A) Significant positive relationship between CGm power and symptom ratings in SCZ (r = 0.18, P &lt; 0.03), verified using Spearman’s ρ given somewhat nonnormally distributed data (ρ = 0.2, P &lt; 0.015). (B and C) Results held across SCZ samples, increasing confidence in the effect (i.e., joint probability of independent effects P &lt; 0.002, marked in blue boxes). All identified relationships held when examining Gm variance (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Notably, all effects were no longer significant after GSR, suggesting GS carries clinically meaningful information. The shaded area marks the 95% confidence interval around the best-fit line.\n\n\n\nDisconnectivity b/w ‘hubs’ -&gt; higher functional connectivity overall\n\n\n\n\n(Fornito & Bullmore, 2015)\n\n\n\n\nComparing neural measures\n\n\n\n(Figure 2 from Porter et al., 2023). Sensitivity and specificity scores were derived using data from the classifier in each manuscript. All manuscripts were able to reliably differentiate participants with psychosis from healthy controls independent of neuroimaging type aside from [169]. The size of points is scaled according to sample size and modality of analysis is shown in various colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 3 from Porter et al., 2023). Summary forest plot for log diagnostic odds ratio for all imaging modalities presented at the bottom of the plot. Multimodal: classification that used at least two of the following: rs-FC, T1, and/or DTI as features. RS-FC: resting state functional connectivity. DTI: diffusion tensor imaging. T1: T1 weighted imaging. The point size of squares and polygons are a function of the precision of the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 5 from Porter et al., 2023)Colors represent different imaging modalities; estimated summary receiver operating curves are shown overlaid for each of the imaging modalities with respective confidence interval regions surrounding mean sensitivity and specificity values. No significant differences were found for classification of internal datasets .

Summary of 18 prospectively designed outcome studies of first admission and first diagnosis of schizophrenia with follow-up of more than 1 year with variably defined good and poor outcomes, showing balanced proportions of good and poor outcomes across studies. Studies 1 to 18 are 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93. Examples of good outcomes: symptomatic recovery with no social or intellectual deficit throughout follow-up (study 2, reference 77); full recovery over follow-up (study 12, reference 87); complete remission and never readmitted (study 16, reference 91). Examples of poor outcome definition: severe chronic social or intellectual deficit (study 2, reference 77); moderate-to-severe symptoms at time of follow-up (study 12, reference 87); chronic continuous psychotic symptoms over full follow up time (study 16, reference 91). For full description of all outcome definitions see reference 94.\n\n\n\n\nBiomarkers\n\n\n\n(Table 1 from Kraguljac et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nNovel therapies\n\nVirtual Reality Assisted therapy (Bisso et al., 2020; Dellazizzo, Potvin, Phraxayavong, & Dumais, 2021)\n\n\nShort-term findings showed that both interventions produced significant improvements in AVH severity and depressive symptoms. Although results did not show a statistically significant superiority of VRT over CBT for AVH, VRT did achieve larger effects particularly on overall AVH (d = 1.080 for VRT and d = 0.555 for CBT). Furthermore, results suggested a superiority of VRT over CBT on affective symptoms. VRT also showed significant results on persecutory beliefs and quality of life. Effects were maintained up to the 1-year follow-up. VRT highlights the future of patient-tailored approaches that may show benefits over generic CBT for voices. A fully powered single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing VRT to CBT is underway.

(a) Social function quantified with the Birchwood Social Function Scale in the BSNIP sample. Details in reference 13. Schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) groups were almost identical, while bipolar disorder (BDP) showed slightly higher scores. Relatives of all groups were modestly impaired. The patterns of impairment were similar across diagnostic groups. (b) The Schizo-Bipolar scale was developed from the SCID diagnostic criteria for these psychotic diagnoses.12 There was almost continuous overlap between these diagnoses with no point of rarity over this spectrum, lacking support for distinct illness groups based on phenomenology. (c) Cognition was measured with the BACS.14 Group scores are depicted for the diagnostic subgroups, showing the greatest impairment in the SZ group and the least in the BDP group with SAD in between, separated by severity; however groups did not show distinctive qualitative cognitive alterations from each other, except for the severity. (d) In the evoked potential auditory oddball paradigm, the patient groups (SZ and BDP) resembled each other rather broadly, with minimal, distinctive differences, discussed in reference 15. (e) The antisaccade error rates were increased in all patient groups, highest in SZ and lower in BDP, without any differences across relatives.16 Again, while severity differences were present, no other distinctions existed across diagnostic groups. (f) Differences between SZ and BPP groups are present after a pair auditory stimulus, including differences in both patient groups in baseline levels, especially before S2.17 (g) Using VBM analysis to determine grey matter volume,21 a distinctive difference between SZ/SAD, on the one hand and BDP on the other, emerged; specifically, SA and SAD groups demonstrated significant and widespread grey matter volume reduction, while the BDP showed very little grey matter reduction in any area. This would represent a difference between diagnostic groups of a qualitative as well as quantitative nature. (h) FreeSurfer showed a similar outcome, with grey matter reductions widespread in all cortical regions in SZ and SAD, while no distinctive reductions in BDP. (i). Resting state fMRI analysis shows a number of distinctive cerebral networks based on ICA, that were distinctive in some or all of the diagnostic groups.18 In general, these networks were different between all probands and all healthy controls."

Across multiple, diverse cognitive tasks, the dynamics of large-scale brain activity engage an integrative core of brain regions that maximizes information-processing complexity and facilitates cognitive performance; only to then dissipate as the tasks conclude, flowing towards a more segregated architecture…Across multiple cognitive tasks with markedly different behavioral requirements, the dynamics of human brain activity were found to occupy a low-dimensional state space embedding that may form the functional backbone of cognition in the human brain.\n(Shine et al., 2019)\n\n\n\n\nThe neural bases of cognitive control (Cai, Taghia, & Menon, 2024)\n\nWe discover a shared brain state across seven distinct cognitive tasks and found that the dynamics of this shared brain state predicted cognitive control abilities in each task.\n(Cai et al., 2024)\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 1 from Cai et al., 2024). We applied a Bayesian switching dynamic systems (BSDS) to time series extracted from brain regions constituting a multiple-demand system involved in cognitive control. We investigated latent brain states across seven different cognitive tasks and four different datasets. First, to demonstrate a shared latent brain state across cognitive domains, we matched task-specific latent brain states with the task-optimal latent brain state SHWM associated with high-load working memory task condition. Two different state matching algorithms demonstrated convergent results. Second, the relationship between the shared latent brain state and cognitive performance in each task was investigated using both multivariate canonical correlation and univariate correlation analysis. Third, we examined the shared latent brain state and its relation to clinical measures of inattention in a developmental cohort. Fourth, we evaluated similarity of latent brain states within individuals across cognitive tasks.

In each task, the component in which linear combination of behavioral variables that best represents general cognitive control was selected to investigate the relationship between latent brain state and behavioral performance. Weights of canonical components in each task are presented next to the axes and summarized in Supplementary Table S3.

    "text": "About the course\nThe first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying the brain. In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior. In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function. The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.\nThis course is one of two required courses for the Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN)."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nPenn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nStudents are responsible for maintaining academic integrity. Violations include cheating on exams, talking to others during exams, looking at another student’s test materials or answers during an exam, removing exams from the classroom without consent from the instructor, plagiarizing (do not copy from someone else!), and dishonesty in any aspect of course participation.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\n\n\nLate, missed or make-up assignments\n\nExams\nMake-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:\n\nContact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.\nArrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA’s or the instructor’s to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nNo make-up quizzes will be given except under unusual circumstances. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.\n\n\nAccommodation for persons with disabilities\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.\nPenn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/), the Office of Student Affairs (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/), Career Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/), the Center for Women Students (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/), the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (http://titleix.psu.edu/), Penn State Educational Equity (http://equity.psu.edu/), the Multicultural Resource Center (http://equity.psu.edu/mrc), and University Health Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/).\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nDirect all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to:\nDr. Kenneth Lehrman III Vice Provost for Affirmative Action Affirmative Action Office The Pennsylvania State University 328 Boucke Building University Park, PA 16802-5901 Email: kfl2@psu.edu Tel (814) 863-0471\n\n\nDiversity Statement\nThis classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. Penn State is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.\n\n\nMandated Reporting Statement\nPenn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law."

Figure 1: General scheme of brain acute-stress regulatory pathways. Stressors activate brainstem and/or forebrain limbic structures. The brainstem can generate rapid hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses through direct projections to hypophysiotrophic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) or to preganglionic autonomic neurons (stress response triggers). By contrast, forebrain limbic regions have no direct connections with the HPA axis or the ANS and thus require intervening synapses before they can access autonomic or neuroendocrine neurons (top-down regulation). A high proportion of these intervening neurons are located in hypothalamic nuclei that are also responsive to homeostatic status, providing a mechanism by which the descending limbic information can be modulated according to the physiological status of the animal (‘middle management’).

FIGURE 1. Effector systems of the stress response. A stressor elicits rapid activation of the autonomic nervous system with its sympathoneuronal (SN) and sympatho-adrenomedullary (SAM) limbs releasing their main effectors, noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis results in synthesis and release of its main effector, cortisol or corticosterone, in rodents.

Figure 3: The brain circuitry that regulates HPA axis stress responses. Stress-induced activation of the dorsal part of the medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNmpd) originates in several brain regions (excitatory inputs are coloured blue with solid lines and inhibitory (GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic) inputs are coloured red with dashed lines). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) receives direct noradrenergic, adrenergic and peptidergic innervation from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The dorsomedial components of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (dmDMH) and the arcuate nucleus (Arc) provide intrahypothalamic stress excitation. The anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), particularly the anteroventral nucleus of the BST (avBST), activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis stress responses. The PVN also receives a stress-excitatory drive from the dorsal raphe, the tuberomammillary nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus and the spinal cord, among others (omitted in the interest of space). Activation of the PVNmpd is inhibited by numerous hypothalamic circuits, including the medial preoptic area (mPOA), the ventrolateral component of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (vlDMH) and local neurons in the peri-PVN region (pPVN), encompassing the PVN surround and the subparaventricular zone. The posterior subregions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBST) provide a prominent forebrain inhibition of HPA axis responses; most of these inputs are GABAergic.

Animal phylogeny. A simplified animal phylogenetic tree (showing the evolutionary history of animals), in which lines represent evolutionary diversification. The lengths of the lines are arbitrary, as they do not indicate evolutionary distance. For a brief characterization of the Anthozoa, Bilateria, Ceriantharia, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Medusozoa and Neuralia, see the glossary. The phylogenetic position of the Ctenophora is not settled, as indicated by a question mark. The Ctenophora image is adapted with permission from Ref. 43, Wiley.

Comparison of neurodevelopment in the frog, annelid and sea anemone. The frog Xenopus laevis (part a), the annelid Platynereis dumerilii (part b) and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (part c) are depicted in their gastrula-like stages (gastrula, trochophora and planula, respectively; upper panels), intermediate developmental (neurula, metatrochophora and late planula, respectively; middle panels) and juvenile stages (tadpole, nectochaete and polyp, respectively; lower panels). Colours demarcate developmental neurogenic regions, and double-headed arrows show the apical (AP)–blastoporal (BL) axis. All views in parts a–c are lateral. At gastrula stages (upper panels), blastoporal ectodermal tissue (around the closing blastopore; red) and apical pole ectodermal tissue (violet) can be distinguished. At subsequent stages, a large part of the ectoderm — incluing the former apical and blastoporal regions — gives rise to neurogenic tissue. The neurogenic tissue comprises regions of distinct molecular identity (indicated by different colours), which will give rise to different parts of the nervous system. In the frog (part a), the neural plate (violet, red and yellow) comprises future forebrain tissue, as well as medial and lateral neural tube tissue; it is laterally bounded by developing peripheral nervous system components (blue). Similar regions are apparent in the annelid (part b), and these give rise to the brain, medial and lateral nerve cord and peripheral nervous system. As reasoned in this article, these regions also exist in the cnidarian (part c). In the frog and annelid worm, these regions are further subdivided into specific subregions by the activity of molecular organizing signals\n\n\n\nNeurons and nervous systems 520-570 M years old\nDiverse nervous systems show developmental similarities at molecular level"

(B) Neuronal cell densities scale differently across structures and orders but are always larger in primates than in Glires. Allometric exponents: cerebral cortex: −0.424 (Glires), −0.569 (insectivores), −0.168 (primates); cerebellum: −0.271 (Glires), not significant (insectivores and primates); rest of the brain: −0.467 (Glires), not significant (insectivores), −0.220 (primates).

News story about Beatrice Gelber from the Tucson Daily Citizen October 19, 1960. © 1960, USA TODAY NETWORK. This image is not covered by the CC-BY 4.0 licence and may not be separated from the article.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gershman et al., 2021) from (B. Gelber, 1952). In Experiment 1 (top), one group of Paramecia was exposed to intermittent training trials in which a wire was coated with bacteria (every 3rd trial during the training phase). This group acquired a conditioned response to the clean wire, as measured by adherence to the wire in final test trials. In contrast, an untrained group did not show a conditioned response. Experiment 2 (bottom) demonstrated that the wire by itself did not drive conditioned responding.\n\n\n\nThis paper presents a new approach to behavioral problems which might be called molecular biopsychology… Simply stated, it is hypothesized that the memory engram must be coded in macromolecules… As the geneticist studies the inherited characteristics of an organism the psychologist studies the modification of this inherited matrix by interaction with the environment. Possibly the biochemical and cellular physiological processes which encode new responses are continuous throughout the phyla (as genetic codes are) and therefore would be reasonably similar for a protozoan and a mammal. (Beatrice Gelber, 1962)\n\n\nTaking stock, we believe that Gelber’s experiments, though not without their limitations, convincingly demonstrated Pavlovian conditioning in Paramecia. Sadly, her critics seem to have won in the long term. Most reviews of the literature, if they mention Gelber’s work at all, quickly dismiss it…(Gershman et al., 2021)\n\n\nIf single cells can learn then they must be using a non-synaptic form of memory storage.

While these gray matter differences could result from using and updating spatial representations, they might instead be influenced by factors such as self-motion, driving experience, and stress. We examined the contribution of these factors by comparing London taxi drivers with London bus drivers, who were matched for driving experience and levels of stress, but differed in that they follow a constrained set of routes. We found that compared with bus drivers, taxi drivers had greater gray matter volume in mid-posterior hippocampi and less volume in anterior hippocampi. Furthermore, years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers, with right posterior gray matter volume increasing and anterior volume decreasing with more navigation experience. This suggests that spatial knowledge, and not stress, driving, or self-motion, is associated with the pattern of hippocampal gray matter volume in taxi drivers.

In Exp. 1, participants underwent pRF mapping. Participants viewed visual scenes through a bar aperture that gradually traversed the visual field. Each visual-field traversal lasted 36 s (18 × 2 s positions), and the bar made eight traversals per run. The direction of motion varied between traversals. To estimate the pRF for each voxel, a synthetic time series is generated for 400 visual-field locations (200 x and y positions) and 100 sizes (sigma). This results in four million possible time series that are fit to each voxel’s activity. The fit results in four parameters describing each receptive field: x, y, sigma and amplitude. b, Negative-amplitude pRFs fall anterior to the cortex typically considered visual (beyond known retinotopic maps). Group average (n = 17) pRF amplitude map (threshold at explained variance R-squared (R2) &gt; 0.08) is shown on partially inflated representations of the left hemisphere, alongside ROIs: SPAs (OPA, PPA), PMAs (LPMA, VPMA) (localized in an independent group of participants24) and the DMN22. The known retinotopic maps in the posterior cortex (black dotted outlines21) contain exclusively positive-amplitude pRFs (hot colors), as visual stimulation evokes positive retinotopically specific BOLD responses. Negative-amplitude pRFs (cool colors), where visual stimulation evokes a negative spatially specific BOLD response, arise anterior to these retinotopic maps in the PMAs and DMN (see Fig. 2a for example time series from a representative subject).\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 2 from Steel et al., 2024). a, PRF modeling reveals posterior–anterior inversion of pRF amplitude in individual participants. Left, PRF amplitude for a representative participant overlaid onto a lateral view of the left hemisphere (threshold at R2 &gt; 0.15; see Extended Data Fig. 1 for example ventral and lateral surface pRF amplitude maps from all participants and Extended Data Fig. 3 for amplitude maps with default mode parcellation overlaid). Posterior visual cortex is dominated by positive-amplitude pRFs (hot colors), while cortex anterior to regions classically considered visual exhibits a high concentration of negative-amplitude pRFs (cold colors). This individual’s OPA and LPMA are shown in white. Both the SPAs and PMAs contain pRFs (Extended Data Fig. 2). Right, time-series, model fits and reconstructed pRFs for two surface vertices in this subject. Top, example prototypical positive-amplitude pRF from the lateral SPA (OPA) in the left and right hemispheres (LH, RH). Bottom, example negative-amplitude population receptive field from the LPMA. b, Memory areas (PMAs) contain a larger percentage of negative pRFs compared to perceptual areas (SPAs) (repeated measures ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected t-tests). Blue bars depict percentage of negative pRFs from individually localized SPAs and PMAs compared to total pRFs in the area (dotted outline). On the ventral and lateral surfaces, SPAs are dominated by positive pRFs, whereas a transition from positive to negative pRFs is evident within PMAs.

R, right; .L, left; CC, corpus callosum; BCC, body of the corpus callosum; GCC, genu of the corpus callosum; CGC, cingulum; SCC, splenium of corpus callosum; FX, fornix; PTR, posterior thalamic radiation; EC, external capsule; ACR, anterior corona radiata; SLF, superior longitudinal fasciculus; UNC, uncinate fasciculus; CR, corona radiata; SS, sagittal stratum; IFO, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, SFO, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; Average FA, average FA across full skeleton; PCR, posterior corona radiata; ALIC, anterior limb of the internal capsule; FXST, fornix (cres) / stria terminalis\n\n\n\n\nAltered network connectivity\n\nThe findings are preliminary, sometimes even contradictory, and do not allow a complete understanding of connectivity in BD. However, they support the theory of cortico-limbic regulation and suggest that connectivity may be more complex than just an increase or a decrease in connectivity between cortico-limbic networks (Townsend et al., 2013) because different subregions of one brain area may have different connectivity with other brain area. Therefore, to understand connectivity, it may be necessary that future studies consider PFC intraregional connectivity (Anticevic et al., 2012).\n\n(Vargas, López-Jaramillo, & Vieta, 2013)\n\n\n\n\n(Bi, Che, & Bai, 2022). Fig. 1: Voluntary subprocesses and automatic subprocesses. The lateral prefrontal cortical regions (dlPFC and vlPFC), which develop relatively late and are involved in higher executive functions may subserve voluntary subprocesses. The automatic subprocess includes the area of dmPFC, vmPFC, OFC, ACC, and are involved especially in the control of emotional behaviors. dlPFC dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dmPFC dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC ventromedial prefrontal cortex, OFC orbitofrontal cortex, ACC anterior cingulate cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bi et al., 2022). Fig. 2: The dorsal cognitive circuit includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), dorsal caudate (dCaud), and thalamus, and is involved in executive functions (e.g., working memory, planning) and emotion regulation. The ventral affective circuit includes the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventral striatum (particularly the nucleus accumbens (NAcc)), and the thalamus. This circuit is crucially involved in reward functions, which are largely mediated by dopaminergic signaling. The fronto-limbic circuit mainly includes the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, and hippocampus. These brain regions are structurally and functionally connected with each other to form a network that generates emotional responses and evaluates whether those responses are appropriate or require regulation. vlPFC ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, Amy amygdala, ACC anterior cingulate cortex. dmPFC dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC ventromedial prefrontal cortex, OFC orbitofrontal cortex, ACC anterior cingulate cortex. dlPFC dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dCaud dorsal caudate, tham thalamus, NAcc accumbens, Amy amygdala.\n\n\n\n\nThis work provides an overview of the most consistent alterations in bipolar disorder (BD), attempting to unify them in an internally coherent working model of the pathophysiology of BD. Data on immune-inflammatory changes, structural brain abnormalities (in gray and white matter), and functional brain alterations (from neurotransmitter signaling to intrinsic brain activity) in BD were reviewed. Based on the reported data, (1) we hypothesized that the core pathological alteration in BD is a damage of the limbic network that results in alterations of neurotransmitter signaling. Although heterogeneous conditions can lead to such damage, we supposed that the main pathophysiological mechanism is traceable to an immune/inflammatory-mediated alteration of white matter involving the limbic network connections, which destabilizes the neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine and serotonin signaling. Then, (2) we suggested that changes in such neurotransmitter signaling (potentially triggered by heterogeneous stressors onto a structurally-damaged limbic network) lead to phasic (and often recurrent) reconfigurations of intrinsic brain activity, from abnormal subcortical–cortical coupling to changes in network activity. We suggested that the resulting dysbalance between networks, such as sensorimotor networks, salience network, and default-mode network, clinically manifest in combined alterations of psychomotricity, affectivity, and thought during the manic and depressive phases of BD. Finally, (3) we supposed that an additional contribution of gray matter alterations and related cognitive deterioration characterize a clinical–biological subgroup of BD. This model may provide a general framework for integrating the current data on BD and suggests novel specific hypotheses, prompting for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of BD.\n\n(Magioncalda & Martino, 2022)\n\n\n\n(Magioncalda & Martino, 2022)\n\n\n\n\nDrug treatments\n\nAnti-depressants not especially effective (Gitlin, 2018; Sidor & MacQueen, 2012)\n\nMay destablize mood\n\nMood stabilizers\n\nLithium (Li)\nValproate (Depakote)\n\nAnticonvulsants\n\nTypically used to treat epilepsy\nUsually GABA-A agonists\ne.g. lamotrigine (Lamictal)\n\nAtypical antipsychotics\n\n\nLithium\n\n“Discovered” accidentally\n\nJohn Cade discovered in 1948\nInjections of manic patients’ urine with a lithium compound (chemical stabilizer) into guinea pig test animals\nHad calming effect\nEarliest effective medications for treating mental illness\n\nEffects of\n\nReduces mania, minimal effects on depressive states\nPreserves prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala volumes\nHas other ‘neuroprotective’ effects (Machado-Vieira, Manji, & Zarate, 2009)\ndownregulates DA, glutamate; upregulates GABA\nmodulates 5-HT, NE\nlevels can be tested/monitored via blood test\n(Malhi, Tanious, Das, Coulston, & Berk, 2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nOther treatment options\n\nPsychotherapy\nElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)\nSleep medications\n\n\n\nProspects\n\nSystematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) cohort\n\n\\(n=1,469\\)\n58% achieved recovery\n49% (of recovered) had recurrences within 2 years\nResidual depressive symptoms can persist\n(Geddes & Miklowitz, 2013)\n\n\n\nBipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP Project)\n\nBipolar and schizophrenia network for intermediate phenotypes is a network of investigator-driven laboratories focused on developing phenotypes, genotypes, and biomarkers for psychosis.

This has established a library of biomarker information on individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis. The founding goal of establishing disease biomarkers for current psychotic diagnoses has been poorly met, because the cognitive, electrophysiologic, eye movement, and brain imaging biomarkers did not regularly discriminate individuals with different DSM psychosis diagnoses. In future, we will use this biomarker information to establish a pathway to biomarker-based classification in psychoses.\n\n\nData shared NIH Data Archive.\n\n\n\nENIGMA BD working group\n\n\n\n(Bi et al., 2022).

Figure 2. Interoceptive Information and Its Integration with Emotional, Cognitive, and Motivational Signals from an Array of Cortical and Subcortical Regions. Interoceptive information of constantly changing body states arrives in the posterior insula by ascending sensory inputs from dedicated spinal and brainstem pathways via specific thalamic relays. This information is projected rostrally onto the anterior insula, where it is integrated with emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from an array of cortical and subcortical regions. As a result, the anterior insula supports unique subjective feeling states. The anterior insula regulates the introduction of subjective feelings into cognitive and motivational processes by virtue of its cortical location at the cross-roads of numerous pathways involved in higher cognition and motivation.

In the red–yellow T-score scale shown are also additional bilateral associations significant with more lenient cluster-defining threshold (p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected) for visualization purposes.\n\n\n\nOur main finding was that higher DEBQ scores were associated with lower central availability of MORs and CB1Rs in healthy, nonobese humans. MOR and CB1R systems however showed distinct patterns of associations with specific dimensions of self-reported eating: While CB1Rs were associated in general negatively with different DEBQ subscale scores (and most saliently with the Total DEBQ score), MORs were specifically and negatively associated with externally driven eating only. Our results support the view that variation in endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems explain interindividual variation in feeding, with distinct effects on eating behavior measured with DEBQ.\n(Kantonen et al., 2021)\n\n\n\nComparing PET and fMRI\n\n\n\n(Figure 2 from Rischka et al., 2018).

Good agreement between CMRGlu and BOLD was observed for primary motor and visual cortices. However, in secondary areas (e.g., supplementary motor area, cerebellum, secondary visual areas) significant changes were only detected with fMRI but not with fPET (Table 2). Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons at p&lt;0.05 FWE corrected voxel-level.\n\n\n\nThe brain’s energy budget can be non-invasively assessed with different imaging modalities such as functional MRI (fMRI) and PET (fPET), which are sensitive to oxygen and glucose demands, respectively. The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems further enables the simultaneous acquisition of these parameters…The absence of a correlation and the different activation pattern between fPET and fMRI suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen demand capture complementary aspects of energy demands.\n(Rischka et al., 2018)\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)\n\nNeural activity -&gt; local \\(O_2\\) consumption increase\nBlood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response\nOxygenated vs. deoxygenated hemoglobin ≠ magnetic susceptibility\nHow do regional blood \\(O_2\\) levels (& flow & volume) vary with behavior X?\nMRI “signals” relate to the speed (1/T) of “relaxation” of the perturbed nuclei to their state of alignment with the main (\\(B_0\\)) magnetic field.\nImaging protocols emphasize different time constants of this relaxation (\\(T1\\), \\(T2\\), \\(T2^*\\)); \\(T^{2^*}\\) for BOLD imaging\n\n\nEvaluating fMRI\n\nNon-invasive, but expensive\nModerate but improving (mm) spatial, temporal (~sec) resolution\nSpatial limits due to\n\nfield strength (@ 3T \\(~3mm^3\\) voxel)\nPhysiology of hemodynamic response\n\nTemporal limits due to\n\nHemodynamic Response Function (HRF): ~ 1s delay plus 3-6 s ramp-up\nSpeed of image acquisition\n\nIndirect measure of neural activity\n\n\n\nHemodynamic Response Function (HRF)\n\n\n\nhttps://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/236/3109590/3109590_TONIJ-5-24_F1.png\n\n\n\n Generate “predicted” BOLD response to event; compare to actual\n\n\nHigher field strengths (3 Tesla vs. 7 Tesla)\n\n\n\n(Figure from Sladky et al., 2013)\n\n\n\n\nfMRI studies often statistically underpowered\n\n\n\n(Figure 3 from Szucs & Ioannidis, 2017)\n\n\n\nAssuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature.\n(Szucs & Ioannidis, 2017)\n\n\nSolutions\n\nMake data, materials (analysis code) more widely and openly available\nOpenNeuro.org, Human Connectome Project, Databrary.org, etc.\nReuse shared data (e.g., Adolescent Brain & Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study)\nIncrease sample sizes, improve detection of small effects\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)\n\nNear infrared light penetrates scalp and skull, refracted by brain tissue\nReturned signal altered by blood \\(O_2\\) levels\nTime course (temporal resolution) ~ BOLD fMRI\nSpatial resolution low\nMore suitable than fMRI for pediatric populations (less susceptible to movement artefact)\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.clinicalguidelines.scot.nhs.uk/nhsggc-guidelines/nhsggc-guidelines/intensive-and-critical-care/near-infrared-spectroscopy-nirs-guideline/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.fnndsc.org/principles-of-nirs\n\n\n\n\nElectroencephalography (EEG)\n\nHow does it work?\nElectrodes on scalp or brain surface\n\n\nWhat does EEG measure?\n\nVoltage differences between source and reference electrode\nCombined activity of huge # of neurons\nCurrent/voltage gradients between apical (near surface) dendrites and basal (deeper) dendrites and cell body/soma\n\n\n\n\nhttps://neurofeedbackalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dipole.jpg\n\n\n\n\nCollecting EEG\n\n\n\nhttps://sfari.org/images/images-2013-folder/images-sfn-2013/20131110sfneeg\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating EEG\n\nHigh temporal, poor spatial resolution\nAnalyze activity in different ‘bands’ of frequencies (via Fourier analysis)\n\nLOW: deep sleep (delta or \\(\\delta\\) band)\nMIDDLE: Quiet, alert state (alpha \\(\\alpha\\) band)\nHIGHER: Sensorimotor activity reflecting observed actions?

However, many diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-α. Together, these findings provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility in therapeutic discovery.\n(Samarasinghe et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 2 from Samarasinghe et al., 2021). a, Schematic illustrating the identification of active neurons by virtue of their Ca2+ transients (I), representation of their network organization (II) and methods used to collect extracellular recordings (III). b, Example of live two-photon microscopy imaging of an H9 hESC-derived fusion organoid demonstrating acquisition of regions of interest (red circles) and the resulting activity profile shown as normalized ΔF/F values, where each line is an individual neuron (middle) and representation of the same data as a colorized amplitude plot (right). c, Addition of 100 μM BMI had a minimal effect on Cx + Cx fusions (top) yet elicited spontaneous synchronization of neural activities in Cx + GE organoids (bottom). d, These synchronizations can be transformed into a normalized amplitude-versus-time plot for quantitative analyses (left) and further visualized as a clustergram following hierarchical clustering of calcium spiking data (right). e, Pooled data of the amplitude measurements. Plots display the full distribution of individual data points. Dashed and dotted lines indicate the median and quartile values, respectively. n = 3 independent experiments for Cx + Cx and Cx + GE. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) P = 0.0011, F = 8.301, d.f. (between columns) = 3 followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test; P = 0.0028 for Cx + Cx versus Cx + GE BMI; P = 0.0100 for Cx + Cx BMI versus Cx + GE BMI; **P = 0.0031 for Cx + GE versus Cx + GE BMI. f–h, LFPs measured from a representative Cx + GE fusion revealed robust oscillatory activities at multiple frequencies during a 5-min period, reflected in both raw traces (f) and the spectrogram (g). Spectral density analysis in h demonstrates the presence of multiple distinct oscillatory peaks ranging from ~1–100 Hz. i–k, Cx + Cx fusion organoids by contrast lack measurable oscillatory activities. Representative traces in f–h are taken from three independent experiments and in i–k from four independent experiments. NS, not significant."
