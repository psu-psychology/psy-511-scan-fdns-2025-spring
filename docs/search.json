    "text": "About the course\nThe first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying the brain. In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior. In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function. The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.\nThis course is one of two required courses for the Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN).",

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nPenn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nStudents are responsible for maintaining academic integrity. Violations include cheating on exams, talking to others during exams, looking at another student’s test materials or answers during an exam, removing exams from the classroom without consent from the instructor, plagiarizing (do not copy from someone else!), and dishonesty in any aspect of course participation.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\n\n\nLate, missed or make-up assignments\n\nExams\nMake-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:\n\nContact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.\nArrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA’s or the instructor’s to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nNo make-up quizzes will be given except under unusual circumstances. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.\n\n\nAccommodation for persons with disabilities\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.\nPenn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/), the Office of Student Affairs (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/), Career Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/), the Center for Women Students (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/), the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (http://titleix.psu.edu/), Penn State Educational Equity (http://equity.psu.edu/), the Multicultural Resource Center (http://equity.psu.edu/mrc), and University Health Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/).\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nDirect all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to:\nDr. Kenneth Lehrman III Vice Provost for Affirmative Action Affirmative Action Office The Pennsylvania State University 328 Boucke Building University Park, PA 16802-5901 Email: kfl2@psu.edu Tel (814) 863-0471\n\n\nDiversity Statement\nThis classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. Penn State is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.\n\n\nMandated Reporting Statement\nPenn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.",
