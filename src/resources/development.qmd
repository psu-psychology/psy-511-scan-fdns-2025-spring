## Timeline of milestones

![[Figure 1 from @Silbereis2016-la]. Timeline of Key Human Neurodevelopmental Processes and Functional Milestones.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0896627315010806-gr1_lrg.jpg){.lightbox width=75% fig-align="center"}

    - Prolonged developmental period...makes CNS especially vulnerable
    - ...makes CNS especially *open* to external influences

![[Figure 1 from @Ernst2015-iz]. Schematic illustration of adult neurogenesis in the adult rodent and human brain. New neurons are indicated in green. (A) Neuroblasts that are generated in the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle (LV) in rodents migrate to the OB, a structure crucial for olfaction, where they integrate as interneurons. (B) Neuroblasts are present in the subventricular zone also in humans, and new neurons integrate in the adjacent striatum, which plays an essential role in movement coordination, procedural learning, and memory, as well as motivational and emotional control. New neurons are continuously generated in the DG of the hippocampus—a brain structure essential for memory and mood control—in both rodents and humans (A, B). A limited subpopulation of DG neurons are subject to exchange in rodents (C), whereas the majority turn over in humans (D) [4–6]. The neurons within the turning over population are continuously exchanged. A value of 100% on the y-axis means that all neurons have been replaced since the individual’s birth.](https://storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002045/1/pbio.1002045.g001.PNG_L?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20240229%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20240229T170130Z&X-Goog-Expires=86400&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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){.lightbox width=75% fig-align="center"}

Shown are lateral, medial, dorsal, ventral, anterior and posterior views of each hemisphere for the first three PCs—i.e. PC1 in (A), PC2 in (B) and PC3 in (C)—mapped on the cortex, demonstrating the anatomical similarity pattern associated with the extent to which the removal of different regions affects the network in a similar way. For each PC, color varies from the minimum to the maximum value of the PC factor loadings. PC1 (54% of the variance Σ in the data) exhibits greater hemispheric asymmetry than the following two PCs and covers the entire left parietal lobe and, to a smaller extent, the left temporal lobe. PC2 (26% of Σ) is—by comparison to PC1—highly symmetric, and includes the entire frontal lobe of both hemispheres, whereas PC3 (8% of Σ) is again symmetric and includes the occipital lobes of both hemispheres.](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/72413/fnhum-08-00051-HTML/image_m/fnhum-08-00051-g004.jpg)

## From structural development to functional development

![[@Johnson2001-yy]. Figure 3: Three accounts of the neural basis of an advance in behavioural abilities in infants. a | A maturational view in which the neuroanatomical maturation of one region, in this case the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), allows new behavioural abilities to emerge. Specifically, maturation of DLPC has been associated with successful performance in the object retrieval task (Fig. 1a)50. Note that although the task itself involves activity in several regions, it is thought to be maturation of only one of these, the DLPC, that results in changed behaviour. b | An interactive specialization view in which the onset of a new behavioural ability is due to changes in the interactions between several regions that were already partially active. In this hypothetical illustration, it is suggested that changes in the interactions between DLPC, parietal cortex and cerebellum might give rise to successful performance in the object retrieval paradigm. In contrast to the maturational view, it is refinement of the connectivity between regions, rather than within a single region, that is important. According to this view, regions adjust their functionality together to allow new computations. c | A skill-learning model, in which the pattern of activation of cortical regions changes during the acquisition of new skills throughout the lifespan. In the example illustrated there is decreasing activation of DLPC and medial frontal cortex (pre-supplementary motor area), accompanied by increasing activation of more posterior regions (such as intraparietal sulcus), as human adults perform a visuomotor sequence learning task77. It is suggested that similar changes might occur during the acquisition of new skills by infants. These three accounts are not necessarily mutually exclusive.](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2F35081509/MediaObjects/41583_2001_Article_BF35081509_Fig3_HTML.gif?as=webp)

### Different hardware = different computations?

>Researchers routinely use motor behaviors (e.g., eye, face, and limb movements) to index cognition in the human neonate.

>When developmental researchers use infant movements to index cognition, they often assume that the cortex is involved in producing the behavior.

>However, cortical control of movement is absent at birth, emerging gradually over the first several postnatal months and beyond; before cortical outflow emerges, brainstem networks produce complex motor behavior.

>Thus, cortical control of the motor behaviors used to infer cognition in neonates is not neurobiologically plausible.

>Researchers should be cautious when making claims about developmental continuity between newborn and adult cognition (i.e., ‘core knowledge’) and its supporting neural architecture.

![[Figure 2 from @Blumberg2023-ce]. Protracted development of motor maps in M1. (A) Representative motor maps in rat pups at postnatal day (P) 25 and P30 and in adult rats at P60. Each map was produced using intracortical microstimulation in the forelimb region of M1 in anesthetized animals. The legends indicate the simple (i.e., single joint) and complex (i.e., multijoint) movements evoked at each stimulation site. Rectangles around the maps demarcate identical cortical surface areas. Adapted, with permission, from [17]. (B) Representative motor maps in kittens at P63 and P86 and in adult cats. Each map was produced using intracortical microstimulation in the forelimb region of M1 in anesthetized animals. The legend indicates the single-joint forelimb movements (shoulder, elbow, wrist) and multijoint movements evoked at each stimulation site. Movements of the digits occurred with movements of other joints. Colors denote the threshold electric current for movement production as indicated by the color bar at right. The black lines show the location of the cruciate sulcus. Adapted, with permission, from [24].
