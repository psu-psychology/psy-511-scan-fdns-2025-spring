## The biological bases of emotion

### Are there physiological signatures of emotions?

#### Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

>This meta-analytic investigation demonstrates that there is no 1-to-1 mapping between an emotion category and a specific autonomic nervous system response pattern. In addition, we observed substantial variability in autonomic nervous system changes during instances of the same emotion category that was not accounted for by experimental moderators (such as the way the emotion was induced). These findings suggest that autonomic nervous system changes during emotion are less like a bodily fingerprint and more like a population of variable, context sensitive instances. [@Siegel2018-ab]

#### Body 'location' of experienced emotions

![[@Nummenmaa2014-ub]. The emBODY tool. Participants colored the initially blank body regions (A) whose activity they felt increasing (left body) and decreasing (right body) during emotions. Subjectwise activation–deactivation data (B) were stored as integers, with the whole body being represented by 50,364 data points. Activation and deactivation maps were subsequently combined (C) for statistical analysis.](https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.1321664111/asset/dcc3da97-2288-4f1c-a175-cad39b111aab/assets/graphic/pnas.1321664111fig01.jpeg)

The body maps show regions whose activation increased (warm colors) or decreased (cool colors) when feeling each emotion. (P < 0.05 FDR corrected; t > 1.94). The colorbar indicates the t-statistic range.](https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.1321664111/asset/3263030e-acb8-4654-9064-b18db4a3a146/assets/graphic/pnas.1321664111fig02.jpeg)

#### Locationist account

- *Where* in the brain is emotion processed?

![[@Lindquist2012-jr]. Figure 1. Locationist Hypotheses of Brain–Emotion Correspondence. A: Lateral view. B: Sagital view at the midline. C: Ventral view. D: Coronal view. Brain regions hypothesized to be associated with emotion categories are depicted. Here we depict the most popular locationist hypotheses, although other locationist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence exist (e.g., Panksepp, Reference Panksepp1998). Fear: amygdala (yellow); Disgust: insula (green); Anger: OFC (rust); Sadness: ACC (blue).

#### Constructionist account

> A psychological constructionist account of emotion assumes that emotions are psychological events that emerge out of more basic psychological operations that are not specific to emotion. In this view, mental categories such as anger, sadness, fear, et cetera, are not respected by the brain (nor are emotion, perception, or cognition, for that matter.

> ...emotions emerge when people make meaning out of sensory input from the body and from the world using knowledge of prior experiences. Emotions are “situated conceptualizations” (cf. Barsalou 2003) because the emerging meaning is tailored to the immediate environment and prepares the person to respond to sensory input in a way that is tailored to the situation

![[@Lindquist2012-jr]. Figure 4. The Neural Reference Space for Discrete Emotion. The neural reference space (phrase coined by Edelman [1989]) is the set of brain regions consistently activated across all studies assessing the experience or perception of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness (i.e. the superordinate category emotion). Brain regions in yellow exceeded the height threshold ($p<.05$) and regions in orange exceeded the most stringent extent-based threshold ($p<.001$). Regions in pink and magenta correspond to lesser extent-based thresholds and are not discussed in this article. Cortex is grey, the brainstem and nucleus accumbens are green, the amygdala is blue and the cerebellum is purple.

#### Amygdala as a 'hub' for *fear*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with a locationist hypothesis of amygdala function but were more consistent with the psychological constructionist hypothesis. Our density analyses revealed that, as compared to other brain regions, voxels within both amygdalae had more consistent increases in activation during instances of fear perception than during the perception of any other emotion category (Table 1). These voxels were not functionally specific for instances of perceiving fear, however. [@Lindquist2012-jr]

#### Anterior insula as 'hub' for *disgust*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with the locationist account that the anterior insula is the brain seat of disgust but were more consistent with the psychological constructionist account that insula activity is correlated with interoception and the awareness of affective feelings. [@Lindquist2012-jr]

#### Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as 'hub' for *anger*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with the locationist hypothesis that the OFC is the brain seat of anger. As compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the OFC did not have more consistent increases during instances of anger experience or perception than during any other emotion category. Rather, as compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the left lOFC had more consistent increases in activation during instances of disgust experience than during the experience of other emotion categories. [@Lindquist2012-jr]

#### Anterior cingulate cortex as 'hub' for *sadness*

> Our meta-analytic evidence is inconsistent with the locationist account that the ACC is the brain basis of sadness, but more consistent with a psychological constructionist hypothesis of ACC function. As compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the sACC, pACC and aMCC did not have more consistent increases when participants were experiencing or perceiving instances of sadness than during any other emotion category (Fig. 6).

#### What does DA signal?

- Hedonia and anhedonia
- Incentive salience
- Reward prediction error (RPE)

![[@Hu2016-yw]. Figure 1. Characteristic response to reward and punishment by different neurons. (a) Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons encode reward prediction error (RPE) signals, showing excitatory responses only when the reward is not fully predicted (Cohen et al. 2012, Schultz 1998). (b) VTA GABA neurons encode reward expectation, contributing to RPE calculation by serving as a source of subtraction (Eshel et al. 2015). (c) Lateral habenula (LHb) neurons show mirror-inverted phasic responses to DA neurons, potentially providing a source of negative RPE signals (Matsumoto & Hikosaka 2009a). (d,e) Recordings from dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonergic (5-HT) neurons reveal diverse responses to reward and punishment, with a substantial subset showing excitatory responses to reward even when reward is predicted (Cohen et al. 2015, Li et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2014). (f) DRN GABA neurons are inhibited by reward seeking and activated by aversive stimuli. Green, red, and blue dashed lines indicate the timing of reward cue, reward delivery, and punishment delivery, respectively. Purple dashed lines indicate entry into a reward zone in a sucrose-foraging task. The responses of DRN 5-HT and GABA neurons to unexpected reward and punishment are derived from calcium-imaging fiber photometry experiments. All others are from single-unit electrophysiological recordings.](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/neuro/39/1/ne390297.f1.gif)

DA and GABA signaling

![[@Watabe-Uchida2017-gi]. Firing patterns of identified dopamine and GABA neurons in VTA. (a) VTA neurons were recorded while mice performed an odor-outcome association task in which different odors predicted different outcomes (see legend on right). Odors were presented for 1 s (gray shading), and outcomes were presented after a 1-s delay. Neuron types were identified based on their optogenetic responses. Dopamine neurons (left) showed phasic excitations to reward-predictive cues and reward. GABA neurons (right) showed sustained activation during the delay. Data from Cohen et al. (2012). (b) Reward expectation modulates dopamine neuron firing. The plot on the left shows when outcome was presented, and the right-hand plot shows when outcome was omitted. Different odors predicted reward with different probabilities. Higher reward probability increased cue responses but suppressed reward responses. Data from Tian & Uchida (2015). Also see Fiorillo et al. (2003) and Matsumoto & Hikosaka (2009a,b). (c) Reward context-dependent modulation of dopamine responses to air puff–predictive cues and air puff. The task conditions during recording differed only in the probability of reward. Dopamine neurons showed both excitation and inhibition in high-reward contexts (left) but only inhibition in low-reward contexts (right). The response in reward trials is not shown. Data from Matsumoto et al. (2016). Abbreviations: CS, conditioned stimulus; VTA, ventral tegmental area.](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/neuro/40/1/ne400373.f1.gif)

Expectation modulates DA signaling

![[@Watabe-Uchida2017-gi]. Figure 2. Subtractive computation in dopamine neurons. (a) In one task condition (no odor, black), different amounts of reward were presented without any predictive cue. In another condition (odor A, orange), the timing of reward was predicted by an odor. (b) Prediction. Division should change the slope of the curve, whereas subtraction should cause a downward shift. (c) Average response of 40 optogenetically identified dopamine neurons. Prediction caused a subtractive shift. Data from Eshel et al. (2015). (d) Three example neurons. Although individual neurons exhibited diversity with respect to response magnitudes, their response functions were scaled versions of one another. Data from Eshel et al. (2016).](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/neuro/40/1/ne400373.f2.gif)

The thickness of each line indicates the extent of inputs from each area (percentage of total inputs). (c) Firing patterns of monosynaptic inputs in a classical conditioning paradigm. Monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons were labeled by channelrhodopsin-2 using rabies virus. Optogenetics were used to identify these inputs in seven brain areas while mice performed a task.
