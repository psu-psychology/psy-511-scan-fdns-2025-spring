## The emergence of complex behavior

### Cambrian Explosion

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNtQwUO9ff8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Sparked by behavioral imperatives?  [[@fox_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1038/530268a)

- Behavior requires energy
- Behavior requires perception at a distance
- Behavior requires action
- Actions require
    - Problem solving, (sequence) planning
    - Current + stored information (memory)

#### Behaviors realized through...

- Perception at a distance of what/where
- Locomotion
    - Approach/avoid/explore
- Object manipulation/consumption
- Signaling/communication
- Physiological regulation

### A form of computation?

![<https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howcomputerswork.html>](https://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/how-computer-works.png)

In digital computers

- Data are in binary (0,1) digit (bit) form
  - Same sequence of bits could be a letter, a number, part of an image, a bit of sound, etc.
- Operations on data, e.g., `add`, `store`, also in binary form
- Distinct (physically separate) circuits for
  - Input (keyboards, mice, cameras, mics, network cards)
  - Processing (Central Processing Units or CPUs; Graphic Processing Units or GPUs)
  - Storage (RAM, flash drives, hard drives, etc.)
  - Output (displays, speakers, printers network commands)
- Software
  - Files that cause operations on data (e.g., implement algorithms)

> There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information.

### Data-driven dynamics

- Cortical states have high dimensionality
- Is there a lower-dimensional space that maps onto behavior?

#### [@Shine2019-lh]

> *The results of our multimodal analysis revealed that the neural activity required for the execution of cognitive tasks corresponds to flow within a low-dimensional state space[43]. Across multiple, diverse cognitive tasks, the dynamics of large-scale brain activity engage an integrative core of brain regions that maximizes information-processing complexity and facilitates cognitive performance; only to then dissipate as the tasks conclude, flowing towards a more segregated architecture...Across multiple cognitive tasks with markedly different behavioral requirements, the dynamics of human brain activity were found to occupy a low-dimensional state space embedding that may form the functional backbone of cognition in the human brain.*

### The neural bases of cognitive control [@Cai2024-qq]

> We discover a shared brain state across seven distinct cognitive tasks and found that the dynamics of this shared brain state predicted cognitive control abilities in each task.
>
> [@Cai2024-qq]

![[Figure 1 from @Cai2024-qq]. We applied a Bayesian switching dynamic systems (BSDS) to time series extracted from brain regions constituting a multiple-demand system involved in cognitive control. We investigated latent brain states across seven different cognitive tasks and four different datasets. First, to demonstrate a shared latent brain state across cognitive domains, we matched task-specific latent brain states with the task-optimal latent brain state SHWM associated with high-load working memory task condition. Two different state matching algorithms demonstrated convergent results. Second, the relationship between the shared latent brain state and cognitive performance in each task was investigated using both multivariate canonical correlation and univariate correlation analysis. Third, we examined the shared latent brain state and its relation to clinical measures of inattention in a developmental cohort. Fourth, we evaluated similarity of latent brain states within individuals across cognitive tasks. WM n-back working memory task, AxCPT Ax continuous performance task, CuedTS Cued task switching task, Stern Sternberg working memory task, Stroop Stroop interference task, SST Stop-signal task, RP Relation processing task. The regression estimate is presented with 95% confidence interval (shaded area).](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46511-5/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46511_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)

- Data from [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) ($n=90$ adults) and [Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC)](https://sites.wustl.edu/dualmechanisms/) project ($n=50$ adults)
- n-back reference task compared with other tasks: AxCPT, Cued task-switching, Sternberg memory task, Stroop.
- What patterns of brain activation are similar in space and time to one another AND predict behavior (task performance)?
- Additional goal was to compare these states to a sample of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

![[Figure 3 from @Cai2024-qq]. Multivariate CCA revealed significant correlations between occupancy rates of latent brain states and behavioral variables in all the DMCC tasks, including (a) AxCPT, (b) CuedTS, (c) Sternberg and (d) Stroop (N=50). In each task, the component in which linear combination of behavioral variables that best represents general cognitive control was selected to investigate the relationship between latent brain state and behavioral performance. Weights of canonical components in each task are presented next to the axes and summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Univariate Pearson’s correlation revealed significant correlation between occupancy rate of the multiple-demand brain state (e.g., SHAxCPT) and cognitive control index in all the DMCC tasks, including (e) AxCPT, (f) CuedTS, (g) Sternberg task, and (h) Stroop. SHAxCPT, SHCuedTS, SHStern and SHStroop refers to the dynamic brain state that matches to SHWM in the AxCPT, CuedTS, Sternberg and Stroop tasks, respectively.
