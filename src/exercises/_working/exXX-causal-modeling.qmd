**Name:**____________________________

## Aim

## Activity

Choose a psychological phenomenon you know well or care about.

Draw a diagram that depicts the relationships among the *principal* causes of or influences on that phenomenon.

It may help you to think about the causes or influences as falling into the following categories:

- External to the person
- Physical/physiological states outside the nervous system
- Nervous system states

If the phenomenon has characteristic behaviors or mental states, please indicate those, as well.

You may also want to depict the flow of information or the direction of causality.

Here is a cartoon example:

## Example 1

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A[Stub toe] --> B(Pain receptors in skin)
  B --> C{Pain processing in brain}
  C --> D{Activate language center}
  D --> E(Say ouch)
  C --> J{Activate motor region}
  J --> F(Move foot/leg)
  A --> H(Toe bleeds)
```

## Example 2

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A[Stub toe] --> B(Pain receptors in skin)
  B --> C{Pain processing in brain}
  C --> D{Activate language center}
  D --> E(Say ouch)
  C --> J{Activate motor region}
  J --> F(Move foot/leg)
  J --> G(Shift balance)
  A --> H(Toe bleeds)
```

## Example 3

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A[Stub toe] --> B(Pain receptors in skin)
  B --> C{Pain processing in brain}
  C --> D{Activate language center}
  D --> E(Say ouch)
  C --> J{Activate motor region}
  J --> F(Move foot/leg)
  J --> G(Shift balance)
  A --> H(Toe bleeds)
  C --> I{Activate memory of past injury}
  J --> K(Rub foot)
  C --> L(Trigger hormone release)
  F --> K
  G --> K
