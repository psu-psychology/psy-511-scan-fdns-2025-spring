>Our results suggest that individual cells may exhibit habituation behavior as rich as that which has been codified in multi-cellular animals with central nervous systems and that the relative simplicity of the biomolecular level may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of learning.

## Announcements

- Exercise 01
  - Scores
  - [Themes](../supplemental/ex01-themes.qmd)

## Last time...

- Neuroanatomy

---

### Where is the cerebellum found?

---

### In what lobe would one find primary somatosensory cortex?

---

### What structure in the diencephalon controls the endocrine system and both branches of the autonomic nervous sytem?

## Today's topics

- [Cellular neuroscience](../resources/cells.html)
  - Neurons
  - Glia
- [Resting potential](../resources/cells.html#neurophysiology)

# Break

## Work on Exercise 03

- Visit [Exercise 03](../exercises/ex03.qmd)

## Main points

- Cells of nervous system specialized
- Convey, process, store information
- Nervous systems enable complex external (behavior) and internal states
- Complex behavior/internal states not reducible to, but inseparable from nervous system states
- Electrical + chemical information flows

## Next time...

- [The action potential](../resources/cells.html#action-potential)
