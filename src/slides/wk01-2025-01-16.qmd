# Why neuroscience is harder than physics

## What do we need to know to answer the question?

- What is the state...
    - Of the world ($W$)
    - Of the organism
        - Body ($B$)
        - Nervous system ($N$)
        - Mind ($M$)

![](../include/img/nested-causality-labels.png)

## Some states are more easily measured than others

- $W$, $B$, $N$ (more or less) **directly**

---

![[@Sejnowski2014-aa Figure 1]](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnn.3839/MediaObjects/41593_2014_Article_BFnn3839_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp)

## Mental states ($M$)

- Measured **indirectly**
- Via $N$, $B$, $W$ (+ prior beliefs/knowledge)
- Examples?

## What are essential components/dimensions of $W$?

## What are essential components/dimensions of $B$?

## Brain & behavior are complex, dynamic *systems* with

- Components
- Interactions
- Forces/influences
- Boundaries
- Inputs/outputs/processes

## Systems...

- "Behave" or change state across time
- Return to starting state
- Appear to be regulated, controlled, influenced by feedback loops
- $B(t+1) = f(W(t), B(t), N(t), M(t))$

## May be thought of as [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science)

![From https://source.wustl.edu/2013/08/brain-flexible-hub-network-helps-humans-adapt/](https://source.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ColeCoverFlexHub470x340.jpg)

## At multiple levels of organization...

## Studying systems is hard because...

- Computation is (often) distributed
- Single parts -> multiple functions
- Single functions -> multiple parts

## e.g., "equifinality" in micro-circuits

![[@Calabrese2018-ve]](../include/img/calabrese-2018.jpg)

## Studying systems is hard because...

- Change structure/function over time
- Biological systems not "designed" like human-engineered ones
- Hard to measure what is being exchanged, what is being *controlled*

# Course overview

## Goals

- Master fundamentals of neuroscientific concepts and facts
- Prepare to read primary source literature in social, behavioral, cognitive, affective, and clinical neuroscience

## Structure

<https://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-511-scan-fdns-2024-spring/>

## Questions

- What is the basic organizational plan of the nervous system?
- How do neurons work?
- How do neurons connected in networks achieve behavioral goals?
- How does the nervous system develop? How has it evolved?
- How do disorders of the mind reveal themselves in the nervous system?

## Approach

- Brain architecture (neuroanatomy)
- Brain function (neurophysiology)
- Brain communication (neurochemistry)
- Changes over evolutionary and developmental time

## Approach

- The nervous system as an information processing system

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3B00P.png)

## Inputs

- From environment, body, brain

## Processing

- Current inputs + brain state + body state + possible future states...
- Stored information
- Physiological & behavioral goals

---

## Outputs

- To brain, body, environment

## Mapping structures to functions...

![[@Cisek2019-vq Figure 8]](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.3758%2Fs13414-019-01760-1/MediaObjects/13414_2019_1760_Fig8_HTML.png?as=webp)

## And *vice versa*?

![[Cepelewicz2021-hq]](../include/img/quanta-2021.png)

>"The brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation...Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex."

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Stringer2019-vf]
</p>

## And do we have the right "psychological" structures?

>"Psychological sciences have identified a wealth of cognitive processes and behavioral phenomena, yet struggle to produce cumulative knowledge. Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging...

---

>...for the study of **multifaceted constructs like self-regulation**...We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct..."

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Eisenberg2019-iy]
</p>

## "Behavioural biologists don't agree on what constitutes behaviour"

>Behavioural biology is a major discipline within biology, centred on the key concept of ‘behaviour’. But how is ‘behaviour’ defined, and how should it be defined? We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important 

---

>...that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Levitis2009-br]
</p>

---

>Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves...

---

>...each other, and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of `behaviour.'

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Levitis2009-br]
</p>

---

>We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: "Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes."

## Does neuroscience need behavior? 

Krakauer, J. W., Ghazanfar, A. A., Gomez-Marin, A., MacIver, M. A., & Poeppel, D. (2017). Neuroscience needs behavior: Correcting a reductionist bias. *Neuron*, *93*(3), 480–490. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041>.

Parada, F. J. & Rossi, A. (2018). If neuroscience needs behavior, what does psychology need? *Frontiers in Psychology*, *9*, 433. <https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00433>.

## Key points

- Questions 'often tacit...belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between brain and behavior'
- Behavior -> understanding; neural interventions -> causality
- Marr's 3 levels (computation; algorithm; implementation)

## But what is behavior?

## "Behavioural biologists don't agree on what constitutes behaviour"

>..."Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes."
