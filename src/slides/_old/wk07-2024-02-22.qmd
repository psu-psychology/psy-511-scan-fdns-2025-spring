## Main points

- Our solar system has a history ~1/3 as long as the Universe
- Multi-cellular animals with nervous systems have a history ~1/7 as long as life on Earth
- Substantial similarities in vertebrate nervous systems
- Brain mass/body mass scaling
- # (& subtypes) of cerebral cortical neurons distinguish human from other primate brains

## Next time...

- Development of the human brain
