## Last time...

- Schizophrenia

---

### What dopamine system is implicated in schizophrenia?

---

### What neurotransmitter system has replaced DA as a target for research?

## Today's topics

- Disorders of affect
- Link to [resources/affective-disorders](../resources/affective-disorders.qmd)

## Main points

- Major depressive disorder a major public health problem.
- Major pharmacological treatments influence monoamines, especially 5-HT, but no evidence for 5-HT pathology
- Bipolar disorder more similar to schizophrenia, despite affective dimension of some symptoms

>...we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, **but not in other tissues or cell types**. [@Trubetskoy2022-hd]

>Our way forward is to convert this question into a scientifically tractable form, which I try to do here by asking where in the human body genetic risk factors for our disorders are expressed. A tentative answer, at least for schizophrenia...“it is entirely in the brain.” [@Kendler2024-fz]

## Next time

- Fear, stress, pleasure, & reward
