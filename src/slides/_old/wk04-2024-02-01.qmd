## Announcements

- [[Exercise 04](../exercises/ex04.qmd) assigned]{.green_assigned}
- Next Wednesday, February 7, [[Exercise 03](../exercises/ex03.qmd) write-up due.]{.orange_due}


## Last time...

---

### What maintains the ion concentration gradients in the neuron (and other cells)?

---

### What do gradients enable?

---

### What direction does information typically flow in a neuron?

---

### What type of glial cell creates myelin around axons in the central nervous system?

## Today's topics

- Resting potential review
- Cellular neuroscience II
  - Action potential
  - Synaptic transmission

# Resting potential

## Potential means...

- *Electrical* potential (voltage)
- Current flows (ions move)
- More current can flow if...
- Conductance changes (ion channels open)

## Why we care

- Fast signalling (faster than diffusion)
- From one part of body to another

## Outward $[K^+]$ flow

- Down concentration gradient
- Charges membrane like a capacitor

## Small $[Na^+]$ flow

- Channels for $Na^+$ not especially permeable
- $Na^+$ flows ___________ (Why?)
- Makes total voltage across (membrane potential) more [positive/negative] (Why?)
- Membrane potential = $\Sigma$ of all ion effects

## Party metaphor

- Annie ($A^-$) was having a party.
    + Used to date Nate ($Na^+$), but now sees Karl ($K^+$)
- Hired bouncers called
    + "The Channels"
    + Let Karl and friends in or out, keep Nate out
    
---

- Annie's friends ($A^-$) and Karl's ($K^+$) mostly inside
- Nate and friends ($Na^+$) mostly outside
- Claude/Claudia ($Cl^-$) tagging along

# Synaptic transmission

## Main points

- Resting potential
  - Equilibrium point (e.g., attractor state)
  - Balance of forces (diffusion/voltage)
  - Combined effects on multiple ions
  
---

- Action potential
  - Short (in time), discrete message
  - Can propagate quickly
- Triggers neurotransmitter release

## Next time...

- Neurochemistry
  - Neurotransmitters
  - Hormones
- Neurocomputing
